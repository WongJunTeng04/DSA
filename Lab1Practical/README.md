# This is Lab 1 Practical.

# Exercise 1: Multiplication using A La Russe method
1. This program allows the user to type in 2 number that they want to multiply.
2. This program uses a while loop to continue dividing num1 with 2 and multiplying num2 by 2 (AS LONG AS num1 > 0)
3. This goes on until num1 is less than 0 or equals to 0
4. Then, there is an if..condition that sees the values of A1 which are odd and the corresponding values in num2 are added together to find the answer.
5. Only the products from odd num1s are added (meaning if num1 is odd, the value of num 2 is added together).


# Exercise 2: Most efficient algorithm
1. This program allows the users to find the most efficient algorithm to use.
2. The most efficient algorithm is seen as the one that has the least amount of steps.
3. The answer you get is considered the steps. The lower the answer, the less steps, the more efficient.
